# Dark Grasp
## In dartkness we roam - for light we grasp

This is my first shot at a vsc theme - it has mainly been designed for my own use, and is (for now) focused on sass.
It is a dark theme with a clear focus on code with neutral background - with colors nuances structured to give you an easy overview of your code elements.
If you like it - please rev. it,
If you dont - please make suggestions

If you need a UX/UI designer give me a hollaâ€¦ 

**Enjoy!**
