# README
## This is the README for my first test theme

This is my first shot at a vsc theme - it has mainly been designed for my own use, and is (for now) focused on sass.
It is a dark theme with a clear focus on code with neutral background - with colors structured to give you an easy overview of your code structure.

**Enjoy!**
